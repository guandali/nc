# nc
implemented netcat in two versions using threads or poll(); 
What we learned?
This assignment has provided us with an excellent insight into socket programming in C. And we also practiced different strategies of multiplexing for servers. Our understanding of handling multiple connections has been improved. 
How we finished this assignment? 
We followed the instructions and tutorials hand-out to complete each step. The netcat in threads is the first one finished. The implementation of ncP is based on ncTh. This program was tested on multiple platforms.
